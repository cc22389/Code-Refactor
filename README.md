# Code_Refractor
Homework Due 9.17.2020
<br>
I was provided an html & css file to refact. 
<br>
My goal was to was to keep the browser looking the same and to condense and simplify the html/css files as much as possible.
<br>
<br>
For reference, these were my specific goals:
<br>
  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<br>
  WHEN I view the source code  
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<br>
  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<br>
  WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
<br>
  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
<br>
  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
<br>
<br>
This was a really good introductory assignment. I will admit I get confused with the pathways of uploading/downloading and creating a github pages link (the why behind it) BUT I think I did it correctly with some help from classmates & instructors.
